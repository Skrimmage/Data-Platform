I recently gave a talk at the [2018 RIT Sports Analytics Conference](http://moneypuck.com/about.htm). As a web developer, I want to show how you can push your data to the web in a way that's accessible to everyone. There's a lot of different ways to build a pipeline, so we'll start simple and then build in new tools. Keep an eye out for the blog posts next week!

**Upcoming Blog Posts**
- Part 1: Using Datasette and Zeit to publish data quickly.  _coming soon_
- Part 2: Download results and turn it into a Glitch site.  _coming soon_
- Part 3: Use Github and Travis CI to download up-to-date data.  _coming soon_
- Part 4: Use Travis CI to auto-update your code and process the data for further analysis.  _coming soon_
