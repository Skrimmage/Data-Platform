## Ideals

Getting started in sports analytics sometimes requires lots of scraping of sites. By using open source and league data, hopefully the Skrimmage project can set the foundation for those looking to jump in for the first time. As the data and processes improve, more advanced statistics and machine learning models will also be open sourced and included.
